## Overview

This web application predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The machine learning model utilizes logistic regression and a decision tree classifier. Users can input their diagnostic measurements, and the application provides a prediction along with relevant information.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes based on user-provided diagnostic measurements.
- Utilizes logistic regression and decision tree classifier models.
- User-friendly Django web interface.
- Performance metrics available for model evaluation.
